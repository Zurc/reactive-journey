### What is this?

discharge: sometimes I'll copy and paste from the references page for the sake of saving time... this is a personal journey...



So,** what is Reactive programming**?

"Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams \(AD$\)."

e.g.: click events are really an asynchronous event stream, on which _you can observe and do some side effects_

You are able to create data streams \(D$\) of anything...

**On top of that, you are given an amazing toolbox of functions to combine, create and filter any of those streams.**

That's where the "functional" magic kicks in. A stream can be used as an input to another one. Even multiple streams can be used as inputs to another stream. You can _merge _two streams. You can _filter _a stream to get another one that has only those events you are interested in. You can _map _data values from one stream to another new one.
